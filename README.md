# javafx-faster-scrollpane

Just an example of how to use JavaFX scrollpane, I've been using javafx for couples of months and struggle with the behaviour of the Scrollpane, so i created an example how to override the default scrollpane speed.

It's just an example, not library, so customize it based on your project.
